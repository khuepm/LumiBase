# 🚀 LumiBase: The Ultimate Launchpad for Modern Apps

> **"Don't Reinvent the Wheel"**

LumiBase is not a final product. It is the **technical backbone** designed to free developers from repetitive, boring setup tasks.

It combines the flexibility of **NoSQL**, the power of **SQL**, and the practicality of a **Headless CMS** into a unified block, ready to take your idea from draft to digital space in seconds.

## 💡 Philosophy
We believe every breakthrough product deserves a solid start. LumiBase focuses on 3 pillars:

-   **Velocity**: Skip weeks of Auth, DB, and CMS configuration. Set up once, use for every project.
-   **Transparency**: Every data stream is clear, every query optimized thanks to the power of PostgreSQL.
-   **Scalability**: From a small MVP to a system with millions of users, LumiBase's skeleton remains solid.

## 🛠 The "Atomic Trinity" Ecosystem
LumiBase is forged from the best modern technologies:

-   ❤️ **Firebase (The Heart)**: Provides the "pulse" with world-class Identity and Analytics.
-   🧠 **Supabase (The Brain)**: Stores and processes data with the intelligence of PostgreSQL, ensuring integrity and complex query capabilities.
-   💎 **Directus (The Interface)**: A sophisticated content administration shell allowing anyone—even non-coders—to control the data underneath.

## 🎯 Who is LumiBase for?
-   **Indie Hackers**: Turn ideas into products in days instead of months.
-   **Agencies**: A standard process to deliver projects with a professional admin interface (Directus) and reliable infrastructure.
-   **Startups**: A flexible launchpad, easy to pivot business models without tearing down old infrastructure.

> *"LumiBase is not just a start. It's a competitive advantage."*

## 🏗 The Skeleton (What's Inside)
To serve as a launchpad, LumiBase comes with:
-   **Pre-configured Auth**: Perfect synchronization between Firebase and Supabase.
-   **Standardized Schema**: Normalized tables for Users, Roles, Settings, and Audit Logs.
-   **Ready-to-use Hooks**: Automations for common tasks like emails, image resizing, and push notifications.
